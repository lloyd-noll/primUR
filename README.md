## Description
Automated candidate-free marker discovery as well as primer design and in silico
testing using species specific genomic regions.
## Introduction
Marker discovery often relies on prior knowledge of potential marker genes,
Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Species
specific genomic regions serve as ideal candidates for diagnostic markers. `primUR`
combines a multitude of bioinformatic tools to automate the workflow of diagnostic
marker discovery and primer design using unique regions as marker candidates.
